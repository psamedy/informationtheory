This is a repo for exploring measures common of information theory.

A potential outline for a presentation and paper.

Background: 
  1. Readmissions - Why is the an important measure in healthcare.
  2. Potential Data Sources for exploratory analysis and prediction.
  3. Electronic Medical Records - Diagnosis Codes
  4. Open Data Sets (Kaggle)

Promise of Information Theory (IT) as a compliment to traditional measures:
  5. How does IT differ from parametric/non-parametric measures

Analysis:
  6. EHR Example: Mutual Information
  7. Amy's Python output
  8. Kaggle Example: Conditional Entropy 
  9. Patrick's Python output
  10. (Traditional) Logistic Regression:
  11 Significant Features

Conclusion:
  12.  Information Theory is a complimentary approach to feature selection
