# Information Theory Measures
This is a repo for exploring measures common to information theory and preparation for a presentation required by SSIE 500 - Copmutational Tools

A potential outline for a presentation and paper.

# Background: 
  - 1. Readmissions - Why is this an important measure in healthcare.
  - 2. Potential Data Sources for exploratory analysis and prediction.
  - 3. Electronic Medical Records
  -- Describe features in dataset
  - 4. Open Data Sets (Kaggle)
  -- Describe Features in dataset
  --https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/hospital-readmissions
  --training.csv is including it repo for general use

# Information Theory (IT) as a compliment to traditional measures:
  - 5. How does IT differ from parametric/non-parametric measures
  -- Define Mutual Information
  -- Define Conditional Entropy

# Analysis:
  - 6. EHR Example: Mutual Information
  - 7. Amy's Python output
  - 8. Kaggle Example: Conditional Entropy 
  - 9. Patrick's Python output
  - 10. (Traditional) Logistic Regression:
  -- 11 Significant Features as indicated by GLM summary

# Conclusion:
  - 12.  Information Theory a complimentary approach to feature selection
