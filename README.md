This is a repo for exploring measures common of information theory.

A potential outline for a presentation and paper.

1. Background: 
  1a. Readmissions - Why is the an important measure in healthcare.
  1b. Potential Data Sources for exploratory analysis and prediction.
    1b.a Electronic Medical Records - Diagnosis Codes (Amy)
    1b.b Open Data Sets (Kaggle) - Patrick
    
2. Readmissions: Promise of Information Theory (IT) as a compliment to traditional measures
  2a. How does IT differ from parametric/non-parametric measures
  2b. EHR Example: Mutual Information
    2b.a Amy's Python output
  2c. Kaggle Example: Conditional Entropy 
    2c.a Patrick's Python output
  2d. (Traditional) Logistic Regression:
    2d.a Significant Features
    
 3.  Conclusion
  3a.  Information Theory is a complimentary approach to feature selection
